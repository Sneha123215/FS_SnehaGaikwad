#Project Title : CommuteMate 
Ride Smart. Save More. Go Green.

#Description:
Many students travel to college or coaching centers using separate vehicles or ride-hailing services, which leads to higher travel expenses, congested roads, and unnecessary fuel consumption.
The CommuteMate  solves this by:
Allowing students to register their daily routes, timings, and preferences.
Using a matching algorithm to group students traveling in the same direction and time window.
Providing real-time route optimization and live tracking to ensure safe and efficient carpools.
Integrating payment splitting or ride-sharing cost estimates for fairness.
This encourages community bonding, saves money, and promotes eco-friendly commuting.

#Problems the Solution Addresses
**High Travel Costs: Shared rides cut per-student travel expenses.
**Traffic Congestion: Fewer vehicles on the road reduce traffic.
**Environmental Impact: Lower carbon footprint with reduced fuel usage.
**Safety Concerns: Verified student profiles and real-time tracking increase security.

#Technology Stack
**Frontend:
React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI
Google Maps JavaScript API for maps and routing
**Backend:
Node.js + Express.js for REST APIs
MongoDB with GeoJSON for storing and querying location data
**Core Services:
Real-time Matching: Socket.IO or Firebase for instant match notifications
Location & Routing: Google Directions API or Mapbox for distance/time calculation
Authentication: OAuth or JWT with student email verification
Deployment: AWS / Vercel / Render
